## Events(js book, pg 246)

1. Different Event Types:

- Here is a selection of the events that occur in the browser while you are browsing the web. Any of these events can be used to trigger a function in your JavaScript code.

- Examples: UI events, Keyboard events, mouse events, focus events, form events, mutation events.

**How events trigger JavaScript code** (js book, pg 248): *1)Select the element node you want the script to respond to, 2) Indicate which event on the selected node will trigger the response, 3)State the code you want to run when the event occurs.*

- You can bind an event to an element. 

- There are different types of handlers, like there are DOM event handlers.

* Event Flow and why it matters (JS book, page 260-261): HTML elements nest inside other elements. If hyou hover or click on a link, you will also be hovering or clicking on its parent elements. The flow of events only really matters when your code has event handlers on an element and one of its ancestor or descendant elements.

* You can also use Event Delegation.
