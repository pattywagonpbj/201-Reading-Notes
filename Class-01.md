# Understanding the Structure, Learning about Markup, Tags and Elements.

## How do we structure a webpage?

When thinking about how you want to structure a website or document, you want to remember it's very important to help the readers understand how to navigate around the page and what it is you are trying to express in the message of the webpage or document. 

An easy way to think about the structure of a document or website would be the New York times Newspaper and the New York Times website. When you look at both of them, they are identicle to one another. 

For example:
- **New York Times Newspaper and the New York times website**
- **People Magazine and People.com**
- **Grocery store websites and grocery store sale ads**

## Tags

When it comes to the code of an HTML document, everything inside of the document are characters the are inside of angled brackets. Just remember that these characters are actually called HTML **elements**. When you are adding elements to your document, you also want to remember that they are usually made up of two **tags**: these two tags are an opening tag and a closing tag. 

**Remember that the closing tag will also have an extra forward slash in it** (/)

## Common Tags and elements.
* <p></p>: This is used when writing out long articles, these help you follow the structure or the flow of a webpage or document. 
*  <h2></h2>: This is a Sub-Heading
* <h1></h1>: This would be used to type out your main header.

## Extra Markup

When we think about HTML, we have to wonder what did it start out as and how exactly has it changed over time.

* HTML 4, released in 1997. It had some presentational elements to manipulate the look of pages. Some of the elements that were used in HTML 4 were: <center>, <font>, <strike>.

* XHTML 1.0, released in 2000. Its purpose was to allow people to write in a brand new markup language. This HTML was widely used as the markup language around the world during its time. Every element needed a closing tag, attribute names needed to be lowercase, all attributes required a value and it had to be in double quotes in order to work properly. 

* HTML 5, is still a work in progress. You don't need a close every tag, there will be new tags and elements, and this HTML will bring about some new features. 

## HTML5 Layout

- <header>: This is the main element that appears at the top of the document. 
- <footer>: This is the main element that appears at the bottom of the document.
- <nav>: This element contains the main navigational block on the site. (main site navigation)
- <article>: This element is used as a container for any section of a page. It can also stand alone.
- <aside>: This element is used to depict whether or not it is used inside of an <article> or outside of that element. 
- <section>: This element groups the same content together.
- <hgroup>: This element groups together sets of one or multiple <h1> through <h6> elements. When this action is used, it makes sure that these elements are treated as one single heading.
- <div>: This element also groups together related elements. 

## Process & Design

**You need to follow this process for your site to work properly**:

1. Who is your "Target audience"?
2. Why should people visit your website? 
3. What are your visitors trying to accomplish?
4. What is the information need for your visitors?
5. How often will people visit your site. 

**How should the navigation be designed?**

1. Consise: Navigation should be quick and easy to move around the website.
2. Clear: Users should be able to predict what information they will see on the page. 
3. Selective: This primary navigation should only navigate through the information on the site and reflect that information.
4. Context: This will allow the user to know exactly what page they are on when navigating. 
5. Interactive: The information on the page should be big enough to where if the user hovers over each item it should change to show what will be covered if clicked on. 
6. Consisitent: The more pages in the website, the more navigation will be needed.
