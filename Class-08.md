## Controlling the Position of Elements(ref HTML book, pg 363)

- Css has the following positioning schemes that allow you to contorl the layout fo a page:

1. Normal Flow: position is static 
2. Relative positioning: position is relative
3. Absolute Positioning : position is absolute

*Some of the other positions are: Fixed Position, Overlapping elements, and Floating elements.*

**How do we float and element?**
- We can float side by side, or even clear out the float completely.

### What is the problem and solution of parents of floating elements?(ref HTML book, pg 373-374)
Problem = If a containing element only contains floated elements, some browsers will treat it as if it is zero pixels tall. 
Solution = By adding an extra element after the last floated box (inside the containing element).

### What can you change with CSS?
 
1. **Screen Sizes**
2. **Screen Resolution**
3. **Page Sizes**

- *You can also control the layout of the pages: Width, liquid layout, layout grids, and CSS Frameworks.*
