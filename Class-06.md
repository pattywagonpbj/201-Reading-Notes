# Objects

## What is an object? (ref JS book, pg 100)

- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names. 

- If a variable is part of an object, it is called a property.
*Properties tell us about the object, such as the name of a hotel or the number of rooms.*

- If a function is part of an object, it is called a method. 
*Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object.*

## Literal Notation

- Easiest way to create objects and a lot of programmers would say that this is the number one way to create objects. 
 *Remember that the object is the curly braces and the content in the curly braces.*

 ### What are two ways to create objects?

 1. **Literal Notation**
 2. **Object literals**

## What is Document Object Model? (ref JS book, page 186)

- As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory. It consists of four main types of nodes. 

1. The Document Node
2. Element Node
3. Attribute Nodes
4. Text Nodes.

### How do you work with the DOM Tree?

1. **Locate the node that you want to want to work with and make sure it represents the element that you want to change.**
2. **Use its text content, child elements, and attributes**

* **What are DOM queries and how do we catch them?** 
- They are methods that find elements in the DOM tree and those are called DOM queries.

### How do we select an element from a nodelist?
1. *The item() method*
2. *The Array Syntax*

**There are many different ways in selecting elements in a nodelist. You can use CSS Selectors, looping through a nodelist, etc.**
*There are also a lot of attributes for nodelists that you can create or remove within that specific list.*

### Understanding the Problem Domain

- You have to understand that problem domains are very similar to puzzles. Also, we wont be given complete information about the problem domain. 

**What can we do to help make the problem domain easier to understand?**

1. Make the problem domain easier.
2. Get better at understanding the problem domain.
