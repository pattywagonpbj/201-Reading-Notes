# Domain Modeling

- Is the process of creating a model made up of code for a specific problem.

*Remember that when you are building the self-contained objects, its attributes and behaviors are going to be the same.*

## Tables(ref html book, page 130)

- A table represents information in a grid format. 

*For example: financial reports, tv scheduels, and sports results.*

 ## What is a basic table structure?

 1. **Table element**
 2. **Table Row element**
 3. **Table Data element**
 4. **Table heading element**

- *Rememeber that you can also control the width, spacing, border, and background of any list in the code.*

## Creating Objects(ref js book, page 106)

- **Constructor Notation: The new keyword and the object constructor create a blank object. That is when you can add the properties and methods to the object.**  

- **Updating an object: To update the value of poperties, use dot notation or square brackets. they work on objects created using literal or constructor notation. to delete a property, use the delete key.**

- *Remember to use proper constructor syntax when creating objects.*

### What are similar to objects?
 1. Arrays
  
### What are built-in objects?(ref js book, page 120)

- Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages. 

Examples of built-in objects:
1. Browser object model
2. Document object model
3. Global Javascript objects
