# What are Links?

## How do we write links?

- Links are created using the "a" tag and remember that you need an opening and closing tag.

- Remember that when you use the a element, it will have an attribute called the "href".

- When using the a tag, it also allows you to click on that link in between the a tags and will send you to that new link inside of the pages. 

## Directory Structure (ref HTML book pgs 81-82)

1. **Structure** The top-level folder is known as the root folder. The root folder contains all of the files and folders for a website  
2. **Relationships** The relationship between files and folders on a website is described using the same terminology as a family tree. 
3. **Homepages** The main hompage of a site written in HTML(and the homepages of each section in a child folder) is called index.html. 

**Relative link types**
- Same folder
- Child folder
- Parent Folder

### Email Links
When tagging an email link, you would still use the a tag, but instead of using the href attribute; you would use the mailto attribute. 

*When opening up links in a new window, you would use the "Target attribute".*

### How do we set up the layout for our page?

**What are the key concepts in positioning elements?** (ref HTML book pgs 363-364)
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page which are the examples below. 

* Block- level elements
* Inline elements
* Normal Flow
* Relative Positioning
* Absolute Positioning
* Fixed Positioning
* Floating Elements


* *Remember that when you develope a website you can add specific tools that allow you to change screen size, resolution, and page sizes. All of this is due to people using different forms of technology.* 

### What are two specific layouts?
(ref HTML book, pgs 381-382)
1. **Fixed width layout**: *Do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.* 
2. **Liquid layout**: *Designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size fo their browser window.*

*Another way you can change the layout of the page is using specific grid changes to the webpage you are creating.*
