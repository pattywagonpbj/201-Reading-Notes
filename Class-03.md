### What are Boxes?

**How can we manipulate the boxes?**
- Control the deminsions.
- Create borders around boxes.
- You can make padding or margins for the boxes.
- You can also show or hide the boxes.

**Remember when changing the deminsions, you are manipulating the height and width of the boxes or the borders of them. You can also over flow your content.**

* *Just remember thtat every box has the same three available properties that can be manipulated or controlled. They are the **BORDER**, **MARGIN**, and **PADDING**.* (Found in the HTML book on pg 307-308)

1. **Border** *The border is the space that seperates a boxes edge from other boxes.* (Found in the HTML book on pg 307-308)
2. **Margin** *The margin sits outside of the edge of the border*
3. **Padding** *Is the space between the border of a box and any content containedwithin it.* (Found in the HTML book on pg 307-308)
